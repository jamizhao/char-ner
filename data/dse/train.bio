we	PRP	O
were	VBD	O
a	DT	O
very	RB	O
poor	JJ	O

and	CC	O
I	PRP	O
never	RB	O
got	VBD	O
the	DT	O

to	TO	O
go	VB	O
to	TO	O

because	RB	O
of	IN	O
this	DT	O

Uh	NNP	O
,	,	O
while	IN	O
I	PRP	O
was	VBD	O
in	IN	O

a	DT	O

my	PRP$	O

``	``	O

we	PRP	O

on	IN	O
your	PRP$	O

to	TO	O
go	VB	O
to	TO	O

So	IN	O
she	PRP	O
said	VBD	B-DSE
,	,	O
``	``	O
Go	VB	O

talk	VB	O
to	TO	O
your	PRP$	O

So	RB	O
that	DT	O

I	PRP	O
went	VBD	O
home	NN	O
and	CC	O
I	PRP	O
asked	VBD	B-DSE
my	PRP$	O

she	PRP	O
said	VBD	O
,	,	O
``	``	O

I	PRP	O
really	RB	B-DSE
want	VB	I-DSE
you	PRP	O

It	PRP	O
's	VBZ	O
always	RB	O
been	VBN	O
my	PRP$	O

that	IN	O
my	PRP$	O
children	NNS	O
all	RB	O
go	VB	O

But	CC	O
because	IN	O
there	EX	O
are	VBP	O
so	RB	O
many	JJ	O
children	NNS	O
in	IN	O
the	DT	O

there	EX	O

I	PRP	O
just	RB	O
do	VBP	O
n't	RB	O

the	DT	O

At	IN	O
that	DT	O

my	PRP$	O

was	VBD	O
in	IN	O
prison	NN	O
at	IN	O
the	DT	O

,	,	O
so	IN	O
it	PRP	O
made	VBD	O
it	PRP	O
really	RB	O
hard	JJ	O
for	IN	O
my	PRP$	O

.	.	O

I	PRP	O
sat	VBD	O
there	RB	O
and	CC	O
I	PRP	O
cried	VBD	B-DSE

I	PRP	O
tried	VBD	O
to	TO	O
be	VB	B-DSE
as	IN	I-DSE
understanding	VBG	I-DSE
as	RB	I-DSE
possible	JJ	I-DSE
because	IN	O
I	PRP	O

my	PRP$	O

to	TO	O
even	RB	O
keep	VB	O

on	IN	O
the	DT	O

for	IN	O

So	IN	O
I	PRP	O
never	RB	O

I	PRP	O
felt	VBD	B-DSE
very	RB	I-DSE

So	CC	O
I	PRP	O

I	PRP	O
needed	VBD	O

take	VB	O

him	PRP	O
because	IN	O
he	PRP	O

so	RB	O
much	RB	O
while	IN	O
I	PRP	O
was	VBD	O
going	VBG	O

But	CC	O
you	PRP	O

be	VB	O
a	SYM	O

if	IN	O
you	PRP	O

at	IN	O
the	DT	O

I	PRP	O
was	VBD	O
also	RB	O
working	VBG	O
in	IN	O
the	DT	O

I	PRP	O
guess	VBP	B-DSE
you	PRP	I-DSE
'd	MD	I-DSE
say	VB	I-DSE
as	IN	O
a	DT	O

because	IN	O
the	DT	O

that	IN	O
I	PRP	O

working	VBG	O

at	IN	O
that	DT	O

a	DT	O

And	CC	O
they	PRP	O
hired	VBD	O
a	DT	O

the	DT	O

did	VBD	O
n't	RB	O

that	DT	O
much	JJ	O

I	PRP	O
had	VBD	O
to	TO	O
take	VB	O

the	DT	O

So	IN	O
I	PRP	O
worked	VBD	O
maybe	RB	O
like	IN	O
four	CD	O

in	IN	O
the	DT	O

that	WDT	O
highly	RB	O
